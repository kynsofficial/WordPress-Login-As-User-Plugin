# aptLearn Login as User WordPress Plugin

## Description

The aptLearn Login as User plugin is a WordPress plugin that adds a "Login as User" button to the wp-admin user page column. This allows administrators to log in as a specific user directly from the wp-admin user page to view contents tailored for that particular user. The plugin also displays a sticky banner for administrators to return back to the wp-admin user page and be logged back in as an admin. This plugin is originally developed and Licensed to aptLearn, but feel free to use it.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/aptlearn-login-as-user` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

## Usage

Once the plugin is activated, you will see a new "Login as User" button in the wp-admin user page column. Clicking this button will log you in as that user and redirect you to the home page.

While logged in as a user, a sticky banner will be displayed at the bottom of the page. This banner shows the username of the current user and a "Login back as [admin]" button. Clicking this button will log you back in as the admin and redirect you to the previous page you were on in the wp-admin.
